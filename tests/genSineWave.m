function [vid] = genSineWave(size,wl,amp)
%generate a Sine wave that can be used as a synthetic test image to
%evaluate the quality of the motion amplification and vector field
%inputs:
%   size - dim[y,x,t] of desired video
%   wl   - number of wave lengths across the y dimension
%   amp  - amplitude as a fraction of the x dimnsion (0-1]
%outputs:
%   vid  - video with a moving sinewave in it

%% generate the sinewave

%duplicate it into 3 channels.
